<h1 align="center">AutoView 3 Help File</h1>

<p>Welcome to the <b>AutoView</b> help file. AutoView was developed by <a href="http://www.autotrain.org">EuroMotor-AutoTrain</a>
as a system for putting video, slides and subtitles together to form an on-line presentation. The entire AutoView system is written in Javascript, so it is essential that you have this enabled in your browser.</p>

<p>AutoView presentations can be delivered in a variety of formats. AutoView
will attempt to automatically detect the plugins available on your computer and select
the most appropriate for your system. You will find more information on manually selecting
video and slide formats in the sections below, but hopefully in most circumstances this
will not be necessary.</p>

<p>Select the topic you require help on from the list below :-</p>

<h2>Browser Support</h2>

<p>AutoView is written to be cross-browser and cross-platform compatible as far as is possible given the limits of current technology.
However, due to the complex interactions between many software components which AutoView requires, there may be cases where the software
will fail to work as expected.</p>

<p>AutoView is supported on a range of web browsers and operating systems (Including Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox and Opera). A full
status list of all known browser issues and browser support is maintained at
<a href="http://www.autotrain.org/services/autoview-browser-notes.shtml">http://www.autotrain.org/services/autoview-browser-notes.shtml</a>
.</p>

<hr />
<a name="javascript" href="#"></a>
<h2>JavaScript Problems</h2>

<p>The presentations make considerable use of Javascript. Consequently, if you 
wish to view a presentation, you must be using a Javascript capable browser, 
and you must have Javascript enabled.</p>

<p>Beyond this, there are certain things that we needed to do, in order to 
achieve some of the effects that we wanted, which can be explicitly 
barred by your browser, depending on your security settings. For example, in 
Internet Explorer the Quicktime Player plug-in is an Active-X control, and in 
order to change the position of the video in response to a click on the 
slide menu, it has to receive a message from the script. It is possible, 
within the security settings of IE either to disable all Active-X controls, 
or to disable the scripting of those controls, even if they are marked safe 
for scripting.</p>

<p>If AutoView attempts to do something that is prevented by your 
security settings, you will receive a Script Error warning. If you receive 
such a warning, it might be worthwhile to review your security settings to 
see if this could be the cause.</p>

<p>We don't like to force users to change their browser configurations, 
particularly when it concerns their choice of security settings. 
If you wish to view the presentation, but suspect that you are receiving 
error messages because of your security settings, try switching off
<a href="#slidesync">slide synchronisation</a>. This will mean that you lose 
the ability to control the video from the slide menu or the buttons above 
the slides, however, it should prevent any errors from being generated.</p>

<hr />
<a name="language" href="#"></a>
<h2>Language Options</h2>

<p>The AutoView interface and presentations can be presented in a variety of different languages, you
can choose your language using the language drop down box shown to the left below.</p>

<table align="center" class="border" summary="Language options"><tr>
 <td valign="top"><img src="lang-small.jpg" width="215" height="25" alt="Language options (minimised)" /></td>
 <td valign="top">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
 <td valign="top"><img src="lang-large.jpg" width="182" height="77" alt="Language options (full)" /></td>
</tr></table>

<p>This box contains the full range of languages available for all of the elements of the presentation you are viewing.
However, not all elements of the presentation may be available in all of the languages listed in this box, so changing this
option may not change the language for all parts of the presentation. If you want to see which elements of the presentation
have a choice of languages available, then click the + button in to show the full set of language options (show above on the right).
Elements which are not listed here do not have any alternative languages available. If the language options are missing altogether,
then all elements of the presentation are only available in one language.</p>

<hr />
<a name="slides" href="#"></a>
<h2>Slides</h2>

<h3>Slide Thumbnails</h3>

<img src="thumb.jpg" width="93" height="108" alt="Thumbnail sample" align="right" />
<p>Some AutoView presentations may be provided with a scrollable/clickable list of slide thumbnails. If these thumbnails are
available, then you can switch them on/off using the thumbnails buttons shown below.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="thumb-controls.jpg" alt="Slide controls" width="161" height="28" class="border" /></p>

<h3>Slide Formats</h3>

<p>AutoView slides can be provided in a number of formats according
to the requirements of your content provider. Presentations can also be provided without slides, so this section
may not be relevant to all presentations.</p>

<p>The slide formats available for the presentation you are viewing are listed in the slide options section,
which can be expanded by clicking the + button. The expanded display will show all available slide formats, with the current format
highlighted. Simply click on the format you want to change the slides.
If an option is greyed out this means that AutoView has detected that you do not have the right software installed to use
this format. You may still choose this format by clicking on it if you wish.</p>

<table align="center" class="border" summary="Slide options"><tr>
 <td valign="top"><img src="slide-options1.jpg" width="130" height="22" alt="Slide options (minimised)" /></td>
 <td valign="top">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;>>>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
 <td valign="top"><img src="slide-options2.jpg" width="246" height="75" alt="Slide options (full)" /></td>
</tr></table>

<p><b>Note :</b> If the slide options section is missing, then this means that there are no alternate slide formats available.</p>

<p>The slide options menu also includes a 'Slide Size' control which allows you to change the relative size of the video and the slides.</p>

<a name="slidesync" href="#"></a>
<h3>Slide Controls and Synchronisation</h3>

<p align="center"><img src="slide-controls.jpg" alt="Slide controls" width="463" height="23" class="border" /></p>

<p>You can browser the slides by choosing the slide you want to see from the drop down box (shown above), which is normally
positioned on the top right of the browser window. You can also move backwards and forwards through the slides using the '<'
and '>' buttons.</p>

<p>Normally, changing slides will cause the position of the video to be moved to match the current slide. You can switch
this behaviour on and off by clicking the 'Sync On'/'Sync Off' button. Switching slide synchronisation off will also stop
the slides from being changed while the video is playing.</p>

<p>You can view a summary of all the slides (if available) which is suitable for printing by clicking the 'All Slides' button.</p>

<hr />
<a name="subtitles" href="#"></a>
<h2>Subtitles</h2>

<p>Some presentations may be provided with subtitles which can be switched on and off using the controls shown below :-</p>

<p align="center"><img src="subtitles.jpg" width="185" height="51" alt="Subtitle controls" class="border" /></p>

<p>You can manually move backwards and forwards through the subtitles using the '<' and '>' buttons which will be shown
alongside the subtitles. Additionally if subtitles are available then you can view and print a transcript of the
presentation by clicking the 'Transcript' button.</p>

<hr />
<a name="video" href="#"></a>
<h2>Videos</h2>

<h3>Video Formats</h3>

<p>AutoView videos can be provided in a number of formats and speeds according
to the requirements of your content providor.</p>

<p>The formats available for the presentation you are viewing are listed in the video options section, which can be expanded by clicking the + button. The expanded
display will show all available video formats, with the current format highlighted.
Simply click on the format you want to change the video.
If an option is greyed out (eg Windows Media in the example below) this means that
AutoView has detected that you do not have the right software installed to use
this format. You may still choose this format by clicking on it if you wish.</p>

<table align="center" class="border" summary="Video options"><tr>
 <td valign="top"><img src="video-options1.jpg" width="121" height="21" alt="Video options collapsed"/></td>
 <td valign="top">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;>>>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
 <td valign="top"><img src="video-options2.jpg" width="231" height="139" alt="Video options expanded" /></td>
</tr></table>

<p>In some cases, if the presentation providor does not support multi-rate video streaming, you may see additional information
on the connection speed each video is suitable for. eg RealPlayer (Modem) for 56k Modem users, RealPlayer (Broadband) for 256k broadband connections and better.</p>

<p><b>Note :</b> If the video options section is missing, then this means that there are no alternate video formats available.</p>

<p>You can also record you current position in the video so that you can return to video later by clicking the "Save" button
and then restoring your position using the "Load" button (this button will be greyed out if you have no saved position).</p>

<p align="center"><img src="position.jpg" width="185" height="22" alt="Save/Load position buttons" class="border" /></p>

<p>The complete range of available formats is as follows (click on the link to view
information on each format) : </p>

<ul>
 <li><a href="#flashvideo">Flash Video</a></li>
 <li><a href="#quicktime">Quicktime</a></li>
 <li><a href="#windowsmedia">Windows Media Player</a></li>
 <li><a href="#silverlight">Silverlight</a></li>
 <li><a href="#realplayer">Real Player</a></li>
 <li><a href="#videolan">VideoLAN</a></li>
 <li><a href="#javaaudio">Java Audio Player</a></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Note :</b> It is not necessary to have all of these plugins installed to use AutoView,
as long as you have one plug-in which matches up with the formats available from your
content provider, AutoView will function correctly.</p>

<h3>Video Streaming Problems</h3>

<ul>
 <li>If you have difficulty playing the video files, or you find that the video quality is poor, you may need to change the
  bandwidth settings for your video player plug-in. Please consult the video plug-in help below or video plug-in help files for
  more information on these problems.</li>
 <li>Some organisations will deliberately block the video streaming or video file downloads required by AutoView. 
  If you find that when pressing the play button, the video player plug-in hangs
  indefinitely trying to download the video, you may have this problem. Switching to an alternative video format (if available)
  may solve the problem. Alternatively, you will need to contact your ISP or IT staff to ask them to enable video streaming/downloads.</li>
 <li>You have a firewall or security product/setting on your computer which is 
  blocking access to the videos. You need to check your softwares documentation to see how you find out which
  applications/services are blocked and how to unblock them.</li>
 <li>Your video player plug-in needs an update. We reccomend at least Quicktime 6, Real Player 8, Windows Media Player 7 or VideoLAN 0.85
  for AutoView presentations. Additionaly, some older versions of video plug-ins may need a codec update to view
  the videos, this will normally trigger automatically the first time you view the video, but if you refuse the
  update, or it is blocked by your security settings, the video will not play. Upgrading your video plug-in to the
  latest version may fix this problem.</li>
</ul>
